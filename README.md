# Incomplete-mnemonic
This GitHub repository contains a script that can be used to check all possible combinations of the 8th and 9th words in a BIP39 mnemonic, and find any valid mnemonics.
This code imports the Mnemonic class from the mnemonic module and creates an instance of the class using the "english" language. It then sets a variable "words" to the list of all possible words in a BIP39 mnemonic, and a variable "mnemonic" to an incomplete mnemonic string. 

It splits the mnemonic into a list of words, and calculates the total number of combinations of missing 8th and 9th words by multiplying the length of the word list. The code then initializes a counter variable, and uses nested for loops to iterate through all possible combinations of the 8th and 9th words in the mnemonic. For each combination, it generates a new mnemonic by updating the mnemonic_words list and joining the words together. It then checks if the new mnemonic is valid using the check() method of the Mnemonic class, and if so, it prints the valid mnemonic. It then updates the counter variable, calculates the progress, and prints it to the console. Finally, it sleeps for 0.1 seconds before moving on to the next iteration. The purpose of this code is to check all possible combinations of the 8th and 9th words in the incomplete mnemonic and find any valid mnemonics.
